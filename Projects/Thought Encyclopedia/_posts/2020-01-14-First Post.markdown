This post marks the begining of online documetation and learning journal. I am creating this site in hopes of presenting the knowlege that I have acquired in my learning expeditions to anyone else following a similar learning path.

It is my intent with this site to establish a repository of record of all the major development and learning projects that I will be pursuing over the course of the coming years. I have realized over the years that alot of the things I've done and learned havent been tracked and noted as well as I would have liked. In more times that I care to admit I have found myself relearning bits of informations that, had I wrote down and stored would have been able to search and easily recall. Because of this I have decided that my documentation should be formalized, organized, stored and available for view online.

As such in beginning my new web project The Thought Encyclopedia I would like to establish a static site to act as the repository of my thoughts, planning and steps taken to translate ideas into action. This site will be the documentation of the processes tools used in creating my web application projects. and to also act as a testament to my abilities as much as the site itself.

My hope with this site is to provide useful information to anyone in puruit of advancement in the field of web development and to showcase my accomplishments and abilits to any future employers and project leaders.
