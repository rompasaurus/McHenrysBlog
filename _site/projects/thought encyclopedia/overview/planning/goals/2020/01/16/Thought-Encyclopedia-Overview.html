    <h2 id="thought-encyclopedia-overview">Thought Encyclopedia Overview:</h2>

<h4 id="premise">Premise:</h4>
<p>How does one organize thoughts and conversations and distill it to its most usable and useful form? Many people keep track of the steps they take in the day, what they eat, how much money they spend where they go but I believe it is equally just as important to keep track of your thoughts.</p>

<p>Its troubling that often the words we need to hear are our own left but without writing these word are destined to be left behind without the means to be discovered.</p>

<h4 id="objective-of-this-site">Objective of this site:</h4>

<p>The objective of this site is to Provide a unique and organized methodology for writing and manging users thoughts and ideas that occur to them throughout the day. In essence this site will be a journal topics and rumination upon these topics that allows for care observation and recall at a later date.This site will act as an individualized journal for each user.Though Journal each user will have their own unique set ideas and topics that they will want to cover the thought encyclopedia will act as the framework for keeping track of thoughts and ideas and allowing the user to come back to them later and continuously organize and develop them.</p>

<h4 id="things-that-need-to-be-done">Things that need to be done:</h4>

<p>I need to continue to write daily my 2000 words and identify and develop and patterns for the topics that I cover, so that I can establish an organizational baseline. As such this site’s framwork will not be realized overnight instead it will be a slow evolution</p>

<p>I have begun to identify key bullet point topics to my daily journaling and  I will continue to add to this list and hammer down a tightly organized schema to all my words then I can begin to translate the process so that others can do the same easily</p>

<h4 id="design-philosophy">Design Philosophy:</h4>

<p>Tabs are key My thoughts are more a list than an essay and they should be presented that way
like XML or any programming language tabs play key role in allow the user to discern the natural order to statements and process and the parent overarching idea that they are a part of.</p>

<p>Tabs will act as the organization tags/dividers for thoughts
The site should be like a note pad but fluid and quick to highlight parent topics based on the tabs and spacing and also intuitively create a list of bullet point topics for the use.</p>

<p>Bullet points topics will allow the user to establish and identify overarching ideas and also allow them to go back and see the progress they’ve made in each topic.Each bullet point should also have statistical information dates and frequency of topic use and word count as well as with the subtopic and related ideas</p>

<p>I will be taking inspiration from my own words to outline and template an organizational data schema</p>

<h4 id="organization-principles-for-these-words">Organization principles for these words:</h4>

<p>Tabs distinguish between a parent and child topic that are related 
Colons: will identify unique bullet point ideas and will be add to a topic back and be automatically bolded and highlighted and underlined.</p>

<h4 id="where-to-begin-this-endeavor">Where to begin this endeavor:</h4>

<p>I will want to start to translate my own words into a website/blog no user interactions or interactiveness quite yet as the layout of this site requires a functional user driven approach.This will allow me to focus on the design style that I want to adopt for the site and allow others to view it as well to guide the design choices.</p>

<p>Continued Jorunalling following the and enhance the style set by my previous project 2000 words a day. I want to begin to formalte a distinct set of topics that I reflect upon dailys and begin to gauge how each topic is prsented and expounded upon.</p>
